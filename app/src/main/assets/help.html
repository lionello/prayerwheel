Spin the wheel clockwise: the mantras are written in the direction of the movement of the sun across the sky.

A <b>prayer wheel</b> is a cylindrical 'wheel' on a spindle. 
The mantra <i>Om Mani Padme Hum</i> is written in Sanskrit 
on the wheel. According to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, spinning such a 
wheel will have the same effect as reciting the prayers.
</p>
<p>
Prayer wheels are used to accumulate wisdom and merit (good karma) and to purify 
negativities (bad karma). As you turn the wheel, it is best 
to focus the mind and repeat the <i>Om Mani Padme Hum</i> mantra. Not only does 
this increase the merit earned by the wheel's use, but it is a mind 
stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion. 
However, it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits.
</p>
<p>
It's best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically. 
While turning smoothly keep in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and 
bodhichitta (the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings).
</p> 
<p>
At the end of a practice session there's a Tibetan Buddhist 
tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that you may have gathered 
during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings. Then <i>Om Ah Hum</i> 3 times. 
</p> 
<p>
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, has said that having the mantra on 
your computer works the same as a traditional Mani wheel. As the 
image turns, waves of compassion emanate in all directions to the 
surrounding area.
